### Activity 5.1 {-}

Indicate what type of t-test could be used to analyse the data from the following studies and provide reasons:

a) A total of 60 university students are randomly assigned to undergo either behaviour therapy or Gestalt therapy. After twenty therapeutic sessions, each student earns a score on a mental health questionnaire.
b) A researcher wishes to determine whether attendance at a day care centre increases the scores of three year old twins on a motor skills test. Random assignment is used to decide which member from each of 30 pairs of twins attends the day care centre and which member stays at home.
c) A child psychologist assigns aggression scores to each of 10 children during two 60 minute observation periods separated by an intervening exposure to a series of violent TV cartoons.
d) A marketing researcher measures 100 doctors’ reports of the number of their patients asking them about a particular drug during the month before and the month after a major advertising campaign.

### Activity 5.2 {-}
A study was conducted to compare haemoglobin levels in the blood of children with and without cystic fibrosis. It is known that haemoglobin levels are normally distributed in children. The data are stored in Activity_5.2.csv as:

- cf: cystic fibrosis: 0=no, 1=yes
- haem: haemoglobin (g/dL)

a) State the appropriate null hypothesis and alternate hypothesis
b) Use jamovi or R to conduct an appropriate statistical test to evaluate the null hypothesis. Are the assumptions for the test met for this analysis to be valid?

### Activity 5.3 {-}
A randomised controlled trial (RCT) was carried out to investigate the effect of a new tablet supplement in increasing the hematocrit (%) value in anaemic participants. In the study, hematocrit was measured as the proportion of blood that is made up of red blood cells. Hematocrit levels are often lower in anaemic people who do not have sufficient healthy red blood cells. In the RCT, 33 people in the intervention group received the new supplement and 31 people in the control group received standard care (i.e. the usual supplement was given). After 4 weeks, hematocrit values were measured as entered in the files `Activity_S5.3.dta` and `Activity_S5.3.rds`. In the community, hematocrit levels are normally distributed.

a) State the research question and formulate a null hypothesis. 
b) Use jamovi or R to conduct an appropriate statistical test to answer the research question. Before using the test, check the data to see if the assumptions required for the test are met.
c) Run your statistical test. 
d) Construct a table to show how you would report your results and write a conclusion.

### Activity 5.4 {-}
A total of 41 babies aged 6 months to 2 years with haemangioma (birth mark) were enrolled in a study to test the effect of a new topical medication in reducing the volume of their haemangioma. Parents were asked to apply the medication twice daily. The volume (in mm3) of the haemangioma was measured at enrolment and again after 12 weeks of using the medication.

Analyse these data fully to answer the research question. Are there any limitations of this study?

### Supplementary Activity 5.5 {-}
A study was conducted to investigate cardiovascular health of Australians. In this study heart rates were recorded by a heart rate monitor on each participant following 30 minutes of intense aerobic exercise. The researchers are interested in whether there is a difference in the mean post-exercise heart rates of females aged 20 – 24 years compared to females aged 25 – 30 years.

A dataset containing the study information is provided in the file Activity_5.5_heartrate.csv. There are 149 observations in the dataset with the following variables:

- id: id number
- agegroup: age range of the females (1 = 20 – 24 years; 2 = 25 – 30 years)
- heartrate: heart rate (beats/minute)

Analyse these data to answer the research question. Write a brief report summarising your results and state your conclusion.

### Activity 5.6
A study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of a health promotion program to improve the fitness of school children. The fitness of 58 children from an inner-city school was assessed by measuring the total distance each child could run in a 10-minute period.

The following data are stored in Activity_5.6_fitness.csv:

- id: participant ID
- before: 10-minute running distance before the program (metres)
- after: 10-minute running distance after the program (metres)

Analyse these data to assess whether there has been a change in running distance after the health promotion campaign. Write a brief report summarising your results and state your conclusion.
