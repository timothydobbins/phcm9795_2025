## Producing a one-way frequency table

The simplest way to summarise categorical variables is with a one-way frequency table. These are constructed using **Analyses \> Exploration**. We will illustrate this by summarising the variable `sex` from the `pbc.rds` data from the previous module.

jamovi has summarised `sex` here, just as we asked it to, however it has analysed `sex` as if it was a continuous variable. This is incorrect: `sex` is a categorical variable. This can be corrected by defining `sex` to be categorical within **Data \> Setup**:

1.  Select `sex`, then choose **Nominal** as the Measure type. jamovi now lists the levels of `sex` as 1 and 2. These should be replaced by the categories they represent.
2.  From the `mod01_pbc_info.txt` file, we see that 1 represents Male, and 2 represents Female. These labels can be added by typing in the appropriate cell. The completed screen should look like this:

Clicking back to the original summary of sex shows that jamovi is no longer treating `sex` as a continuous variable, but there is little output in the summary:

Click **Frequency tables** in the main Descriptives window to request the one-way frequency table:

## Producing a two-way frequency table

Two-way tables are constructed using **Analyses > Frequencies > Contingency Tables > Independent Samples**. Note that **both variables must be defined as Nominal variables**. As an example, to produce a two-way table of disease stage by sex:

**Ignore the output labelled χ^2^ tests for now.**

Row or column percents can be requested in the **Cells** section. For example, to calculate the proportion of males within each stage of disease, we would request column percents:

## Creating bar charts for one categorical variable

Here we will create the bar chart shown in @fig-bar-1 using the `mod01_pbc.rds` dataset. The x-axis of this graph will be the stage of disease, and the y-axis will show the number of participants in each category.

Bar charts are created in the **Exploration** tab. We can summarise `stage`, and request a **Frequency table** in the usual way. To request a bar chart as well, tick **Bar plot** within the **Plots** section:

## Creating bar charts for two categorical variables

Creating a **clustered bar chart** as shown in @fig-bar-2 can be done using **Analyses > Frequencies > Contingency Tables > Independent Samples**. First create the cross-tab of interest, for example, Stage by Sex. Choose **Plots > Bar Plot**, and ensure the Bar Type is selected as **Side by side**. Choose the X-axis as required - here we want to see stage on the x-axis, so we choose the x-axis to be columns (this may need to be adjusted according to how your table has been set up):

![](img/mod02/jamovi/mod02-clustered.png)
To create a **stacked bar chart** (as in @fig-bar-3), choose the Bar Type to be **Stacked**:

![](img/mod02/jamovi/mod02-stacked.png)

Finally, to create a **stacked relative bar chart** (as in @fig-bar-4), choose the Y-axis to be **Percentages within column**:

## Recoding data {#sec-recoding-data-jmv}

One task that is common in statistical computing is to recode variables. For example, we might want to group some categories of a categorical variable, or to present a continuous variable in a categorical way.

In this example, we can use the `pbc` data and recode age into age groups:

-   Less than 30
-   30 to less than 50
-   50 to less than 70
-   70 or older

Recoding can be done using **Data > Transform**.

First, click **Data** to view the spreadsheet, then click in an empty column, then click **Setup > NEW TRANSFORMED VARIABLE**. We need to specify three things:

1. The name of the new variable. Here, we will choose `age group`.
2. The source variable. Here, we want to recode **from** `age`, so choose `age`.
3. The `transform`, which is where we define the rules of the recode. Choose **Create New Transform**.

![](img/mod02/jamovi/mod02-recode2.png)

The `transform` is built up by specifying the **recode conditions**. Click **+ Add recode condition** to define the first condition:

![](img/mod02/jamovi/mod02-recode3.png)

Here we want to define all ages less than 30 as "Less than 30". Complete the recode condition so it appears as: `if $source < 30 use "Less than 30"`. Note that the quotation marks around "Less than 30" are required:

![](img/mod02/jamovi/mod02-recode4.png)

Add another recode condition, which will be applied if the first condition is not satisfied: `if $source < 50 use "30 to less than 50"`:

![](img/mod02/jamovi/mod02-recode5.png)

Add another condition: `if $source < 70 use "50 to less than 70"`. There is no need to add a condition for the final condition, simply complete the final line: `else use "70 or more"`:

![](img/mod02/jamovi/mod02-recode6.png)

Finally, click the **down** arrow to dismiss the transform builder, and the **up** arrow to dismiss the transform dialog.

We can examine the new categories by obtaining a frequency table: **Analyses > Exploration > Descriptives**:

## Computing binomial probabilities

jamovi does not have a point-and-click method for computing probabilities from a binomial distribution. Here, instructions are provided for using a third-party applet. This Binomial Distribution Applet has been posted at https://homepage.stat.uiowa.edu/~mbognar/applets/bin.html, and provides a simple and intuitive way to compute probabilities from a binomial distribution. 

The applet requires three pieces of information:

- $/n$: the number of binary trials being considered
- $/p$: the probability of "success" in each trial
- $x$: the number of success we are interested in

We also need to consider whether we are interested in the probability being equal to, greater than, or less than x.

To do the computation for part (a) in Worked Example 2.1:

-   *x* is the number of successes, here, the number of smokers (i.e. x=3);
-   *n* is the number of trials (i.e. n=6);
-   and *p* is probability of drawing a smoker from the population, which is 19.8% (i.e. p=0.198).

Replace each of these with the appropriate number into the applet:

![](img/mod02/jamovi/mod02-bin-01.png)

To calculate the probability of at least 4 smokers in part (b), we change the drop-down to "P(X≥x)", and x to be equal to 4:

![](img/mod02/jamovi/mod02-bin-02.png)

To calculate the probability of at most 2 smokers part (c), we we change the drop-down to "P(X≤x)", and x to be equal to 2:
