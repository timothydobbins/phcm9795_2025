## Computing probabilities from a Normal distribution {#sec-normal-r}

jamovi does not have a point-and-click method for computing probabilities from a Normal distribution. Here, instructions are provided for using a third-party applet. This Normal Distribution Applet has been posted at https://homepage.stat.uiowa.edu/~mbognar/applets/normal.html, and provides a simple and intuitive way to compute probabilities from a Normal distribution. The applet requires three pieces of information:

- $\mu$: the mean of the Normal distribution being considered
- $\sigma$: the standard deviation of the Normal distribution being considered
- $x$: the value being considered

We also need to consider whether we are interested in the probability being greater than x, or less than x.

For example, to obtain the probability of obtaining 0.5 or greater from a standard normal (i.e. $/mu$=0, $/sigma$=1) distribution:

The Normal curve of interest is shaded, and the probability is provided as 0.30854.

To calculate the worked example: Assume that the mean diastolic blood pressure for men is 77.9 mmHg, with a standard deviation of 11. What is the probability that a man selected at random will have high blood pressure (i.e. diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 90)?

## Calculating a 95% confidence interval of a mean: Individual data {#sec-cimean-jamovi-ind}

To demonstrate the computation of the 95% confidence interval of a mean, we can use the data from `mod03_blood_pressure.csv`. We can use **Exploration > Descriptives** to calculate the mean, its standard error and the 95% confidence interval for the mean. Choose **dbp** as the analysis variable, and select **Std. error of Mean** and **Confidence interval for Mean** in the **Statistics** section:

The descriptives output appears:

## Calculating a 95% confidence interval of a mean: Summarised data {#sec-cimean-jamovi-summ}

For Worked Example 3.2 where we are given the sample mean, sample standard deviation and sample size, we need to install a new Jamovi module, called **esci**. To install a new module, click the large **+ Modules** button on the right-hand side of the Jamovi window, and then choose **jamovi library**:

To install a new module:

1 - Ensure that the middle tab, **Available** is selected;
2 - Type **esci** in the search bar. The **esci** module will appear;
3 - Click **INSTALL** to install the module
4 - Click the up-arrow to exit from the Install Module window

To calculate the 95% confidence interval, choose **esci > Means and Medians > Single Group**. Select the **Analyze summary data** tab, and enter the known information: here `128.4` as the **Mean**, `19.56` as the **Standard deviation** and `242` as the **Sample size**. Choose **Extra details** to obtain the Standard Error of the mean:

The 95% confidence interval is listed as the lower limit (LL) and the upper limit (UL):
