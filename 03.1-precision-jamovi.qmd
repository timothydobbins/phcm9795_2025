## Generating new variables

We commonly need to create new variables based on existing variables in our data. For example, body size is often summarised using the **Body Mass Index (BMI)**. BMI is calculated as: $\frac{\text{weight (kg)}}{\text{height (m)}^2}$.

In this demonstration, we will import a selection of records from a large health survey, stored in the file `mod03_health_survey.xlsx`. The health survey data contains 1140 records, comprising:
 
- sex: 1 = respondent identifies as male; 2 = respondent identifies as female
- height: height in meters
- weight: weight in kilograms

To generate a new variable, we use **Data > Compute**:

1. click **Data** to open the spreadsheet, and click into an empty column
2. click **Setup** then **NEW COMPUTED VARIABLE**
3. enter the name of the new variable, here `BMI`
4. in the formula (*f~x~) box enter: `weight / height^2` (note: ^2 represents "to the power of 2", or "squared")

You should check the construction of any new variable buy examining a density plot and/or a boxplot:

In the general population, BMI ranges between about 15 to 30. It appears that BMI has been correctly generated in this example, perhaps with some unsual values that might require investigation.

## Summarising data by another variable

We will often want to calculate the same summary statistics by another variable. For example, we might want to calculate summary statistics for BMI for males and females separately. We can do this in jamovi by defining sex as a *by-variable*.

This can be done easily in jamovi by defining a **Split by** variable. For example, to summarise BMI for males and females separately, we use `sex` as the Split by variable:

## Computing probabilities from a Normal distribution {#sec-normal-jamovi}

jamovi does not have a point-and-click method for computing probabilities from a Normal distribution. Here, instructions are provided for using a third-party applet. This Normal Distribution Applet has been posted at https://homepage.stat.uiowa.edu/~mbognar/applets/normal.html, and provides a simple and intuitive way to compute probabilities from a Normal distribution. The applet requires three pieces of information:

- $\mu$: the mean of the Normal distribution being considered
- $\sigma$: the standard deviation of the Normal distribution being considered
- $x$: the value being considered

We also need to consider whether we are interested in the probability being greater than x, or less than x.

For example, to obtain the probability of obtaining 0.5 or greater from a standard normal (i.e. $/mu$=0, $/sigma$=1) distribution:

The Normal curve of interest is shaded, and the probability is provided as 0.30854.

To calculate the worked example: Assume that the mean diastolic blood pressure for men is 77.9 mmHg, with a standard deviation of 11. What is the probability that a man selected at random will have high blood pressure (i.e. diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 90)?

## Calculating a 95% confidence interval of a mean: Individual data {#sec-cimean-jamovi-ind}

To demonstrate the computation of the 95% confidence interval of a mean, we can use the data from `mod03_blood_pressure.csv`. We can use **Exploration > Descriptives** to calculate the mean, its standard error and the 95% confidence interval for the mean. Choose **dbp** as the analysis variable, and select **Std. error of Mean** and **Confidence interval for Mean** in the **Statistics** section:

The descriptives output appears:

## Calculating a 95% confidence interval of a mean: Summarised data {#sec-cimean-jamovi-summ}

For Worked Example 3.2 where we are given the sample mean, sample standard deviation and sample size, we need to install a new Jamovi module, called **esci**. To install a new module, click the large **+ Modules** button on the right-hand side of the Jamovi window, and then choose **jamovi library**:

![](img/mod03/jamovi/mod3-inst-module1.png)

To install a new module:

1 - Ensure that the middle tab, **Available** is selected;
2 - Type **esci** in the search bar. The **esci** module will appear;
3 - Click **INSTALL** to install the module
4 - Click the up-arrow to exit from the Install Module window

![](img/mod03/jamovi/mod3-inst-module2.png)

To calculate the 95% confidence interval, choose **esci > Means and Medians > Single Group**. Select the **Analyze summary data** tab, and enter the known information: here `128.4` as the **Mean**, `19.56` as the **Standard deviation** and `242` as the **Sample size**. Choose **Extra details** to obtain the Standard Error of the mean:

![](img/mod03/jamovi/mod3-cii1.png)

The 95% confidence interval is listed as the lower limit (LL) and the upper limit (UL):
