## Pearson’s chi-squared test for individual-level data

We will demonstrate how to use R to conduct a Pearson chi-squared test using Worked Example 7.1.

```{r}
library(jmv)

nausea <- readRDS("data/examples/mod06_nausea.rds")

head(nausea)

str(nausea$group)
str(nausea$side_effect)
```

The columns `group` and `side_effect` have been entered as factors, with "Placebo" and "No nausea" as the first levels. We should use the `relevel()` command to re-order the factor levels.

```{r}
nausea$group <- relevel(nausea$group, ref = "Active")
nausea$side_effect <- relevel(nausea$side_effect, ref = "Nausea")

str(nausea$group)
str(nausea$side_effect)
```

After confirming the factors are appropriately defined, we can construct our 2-by-2 table and view the expected frequencies.

```{r}
contTables(
    data = nausea,
    rows = group, cols = side_effect,
    exp = TRUE
)
```

After confirming that there are no cells with small expected frequencies, we can interpret the chi-square test. The last section reports the chi-squared test statistic which has a value of 7.86 with 1 degree of freedom and a P-value of 0.005.

If there are small values of expected frequencies, Fisher's exact test can be requested using `fisher = TRUE`:

```{r}
contTables(
    data = nausea,
    rows = group, cols = side_effect,
    fisher = TRUE
)
```

## Pearson’s chi-squared test for summarised data

When you only have the summarised date (for example, the cross-tabulated data), you need to enter the summarised data manually. As we did in Module 6, the 2-by-2 table can be entered as four lines of data:

```{r}
drug_aggregated <- data.frame(
    group = c("Active", "Active", "Placebo", "Placebo"),
    side_effect = c("Nausea", "No nausea", "Nausea", "No nausea"),
    n = c(15, 35, 4, 46)
)
```

The `contTables()` function is used in the usual way, specifying `count=n`.

## Chi-squared test for tables larger than 2-by-2
Use the data in `mod07_allergy.rds`. We use similar steps as described above for a 2-by-2 table.

```{r}
allergy <- readRDS("data/examples/mod07_allergy.rds")

head(allergy)
```

```{r}
contTables(
    data = allergy,
    rows = allergy_severity, cols = sex,
    pcCol = TRUE
)
```


## McNemar’s test for paired proportions

To perform this test in R, we will use the dataset `mod07_drug_response.rds`. 

```{r}
drug <- readRDS("data/examples/mod07_drug_response.rds")

head(drug)
```

As usual, we should check that the variables being tabulated are factors, with the first level of the factor being the outcome of interest.

```{r}
str(drug$druga)
str(drug$drugb)
```

Here we see that the first level of the factor is "No" - we need to use the `relevel()` function to re-order the levels so "Yes" is the first level:

```{r}
drug$druga <- relevel(drug$druga, ref = "Yes")
drug$drugb <- relevel(drug$drugb, ref = "Yes")

str(drug$druga)
str(drug$drugb)
```

We can use the `contTablesPaired()` function within the `jmv` library to conduct McNemar's test of paired proportions:

```{r}
contTablesPaired(data = drug, rows = druga, cols = drugb)
```

Note that `contTablesPaired()` does not calculate an exact P-value.

To estimate the proportion in each of the paired samples, its difference, and the 95% confidence interval of the difference, we can use the `mcNemarDiff()` function which can be downloaded [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/timothydobbins/525d25271b04b2ea72aae70c4aac8b01/raw/6b69f5b229d50daeac4c2f4cf4331e88b0c65717/mcNemarDiff.R).

```{r}

        format(round(pd, digits = digits), nsmall = digits),
        "; 95% CI: ", format(round(pd.cil, digits = digits), nsmall = digits),

    ))

In this study of 60 participants, where each participant received both drugs, 41 (68%) responded to Drug A and 35 (58%) responded to Drug B. The difference in the proportions responding is estimated as 10% (95% CI -11% to 31%). There is no evidence that the response differed between the two drugs (McNemar’s chi-squared = 1.06 with 1df, P=0.30).
