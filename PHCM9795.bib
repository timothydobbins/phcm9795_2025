Taking readers through the common statistical methods seen in published research and guidelines, the text focuses on how to interpret and analyse statistics for clinical practice. Using extracts from real studies, the author illustrates how data can be employed correctly and incorrectly in medical research helping readers to evaluate the statistics they encounter and appropriately implement findings in clinical practice.   End of chapter exercises, case studies and multiple choice questions help readers to apply their learning and develop their own interpretative skills.

Data visualised in tables (and graphs) are key components in any scientific report, but their design leaves much to be desired. This article focuses on table design, following two general principles: clear vision and clear understanding. Clear vision is achieved by maximising the signal to noise ratio. In a table, the signal is the data in the form of numbers, and the noise is the support structure necessary to interpret the numbers. Clear understanding is achieved when the story in the data is told effectively, through organisation of the data and use of text. These principles are illustrated by original and improved tables from recent publications. Two special cases are discussed separately: tables produced by the pharmaceutical industry (in clinical study reports and reports to data safety monitoring boards), and study flow diagrams as proposed by the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses initiatives.},

The erratic behavior of the coverage probability of the standard Wald confidence interval has previously been remarked on in the literature (Blyth and Still, Agresti and Coull, Santner and others). We begin by showing that the chaotic coverage properties of the Wald interval are far more persistent than is appreciated. Furthermore, common textbook prescriptions regarding its safety are misleading and defective in several respects and cannot be trusted. This leads us to consideration of alternative intervals. A number of natural alternatives are presented, each with its motivation and context. Each interval is examined for its coverage probability and its length. Based on this analysis, we recommend the Wilson interval or the equal-tailed Jeffreys prior interval for small n and the interval suggested in Agresti and Coull for larger n. We also provide an additional frequentist justification for use of the Jeffreys interval.}

Quotation from the film Amadeus (1984) As a statistical reviewer for Archives and BMJ I am interested in the presentation of numerical data.1 It concerns me that numbers are often reported to excessive precision, because too many digits can swamp the reader, overcomplicate the story and obscure the message. A number's precision relates to its decimal places or significant figures (or as preferred here, significant digits ). The number of decimal places is the number of digits to the right of the decimal point, while the number of significant digits is the number of all digits ignoring the decimal point, and ignoring all leading zeros and some trailing zeros (for a fuller definition see `significant figures' on Wikipedia). Ideally data should be rounded appropriately, not too much and not too little (one might call it Goldilocks rounding).2 The European Association of Science Editors guidelines include the useful rule of thumb: ``numbers should be given in (sic) 2--3 effective digits''.3 Take as an example the odds ratio (OR) of 22.68 (95\% CI 7.51 to 73.67) comparing beta mimetics with placebo for side effects requiring a change of medication.4 Its two decimal places and four significant digits are excessive when the effect size and confidence interval (CI) are so large. Reporting it rounded to two significant digits, as 23 (7.5 to 74), or even as 23 (8 to 70), with one {\dots}},

Here, effectiveness is more commonly expressed as the percentage relative risk reduction (100=D7(1-relative risk)\%) than the actual relative risk. The discrepancy between a relative risk reduction and the equivalent relative odds reduction (100=D7(1-odds ratio)\%) can be misleading. When event rates are high (commonly the case in trials and systematic reviews) the relative odds reduction can be many times larger than the equivalent relative risk reduction. For example, Brent et al report results of a trial of a programme aimed at increasing the duration of breast feeding.2 By three months 32/51(63\%) women had stopped breast feeding in the intervention group, compared with 52/57(91\%) in the control group. Whereas the relative risk reduction is 31\% the relative odds reduction is 84\%: nearly three times as large. The same problem can occur in systematic reviews: a summary of the results of seven trials of antimicrobial treatment on premature rupture of membranes showed a 49\% relative odds reduction of delivery by seven days, whereas the relative risk reduction was only 19\%.3 Although relative odds and relative risk reductions always go in the same direction, these discrepancies {\dots}},

More often than not, when these conditions are not met, Student's t-test can be severely biased and lead to invalid statistical inferences. Moreover, we argue that the assumption of equal variances will seldom hold in psychological research, and choosing between Student's t-test and Welch's t-test based on the outcomes of a test of the equality of variances often fails to provide an appropriate answer. We show that the Welch's t-test provides a better control of Type 1 error rates when the assumption of homogeneity of variance is not met, and it loses little robustness compared to Student's t-test when the assumptions are met. We argue that Welch's t-test should be used as a default strategy.~Publisher's Note: A correction article relating to this paper has been published and can be found at https://www.rips-irsp.com/articles/10.5334/irsp.661/.},

  abstract = {Often in the study of behavioral ecology, and more widely in science, we require to statistically test whether the central tendencies (mean or median) of 2 groups are different from each other on the basis of samples of the 2 groups. In surveying recent issues of Behavioral Ecology (Volume 16, issues 1--5), I found that, of the 130 papers, 33 (25\%) used at least one statistical comparison of this sort. Three different tests were used to make this comparison: Student's t-test (67 occasions; 26 papers), Mann--Whitney U test (43 occasions; 21 papers), and the t-test for unequal variances (9 occasions; 4 papers). My aim in this forum article is to argue for the greater use of the last of these tests. The numbers just related suggest that this test is not commonly used. In my survey, I was able to identify tests described simply as ``t-tests'' with confidence as either a Student's t-test or an unequal variance t-test because the calculation of degrees of freedom from the 2 sample sizes is different for the 2 tests (see below). Hence, the neglect of the unequal variance t-test illustrated above is a real phenomenon and can be explained in several (nonexclusive ways) ways:Argument 4 relies on the central limit theorem and would require a combined sample size of at least 30 (Sokal and Rohlf 1987, p. 107); however, in my survey, the majority (47 out of 61) of tests for which sample sizes were provided had a combined sample size below 30. The fallacy of argument 3 has been demonstrated previously on several occasions (e.g., Kasuya 2001; Neuhauser 2002). To explore argument 1 further, imagine that we have 2 sample groups (labeled ``1'' and ``2,'' with means [{$\mu$}1 and {$\mu$}2], variances [{\textbackslash}batchmode {\textbackslash}documentclass[fleqn,10pt,legalpaper]\{article\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{amssymb\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{amsfonts\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{amsmath\} {\textbackslash}pagestyle\{empty\} {\textbackslash}begin\{document\} {\textbackslash}(s\_\{1\}\^{}\{2\}{\textbackslash}) {\textbackslash}end\{document\} and {\textbackslash}batchmode {\textbackslash}documentclass[fleqn,10pt,legalpaper]\{article\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{amssymb\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{amsfonts\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{amsmath\} {\textbackslash}pagestyle\{empty\} {\textbackslash}begin\{document\} {\textbackslash}(s\_\{2\}\^{}\{2\}{\textbackslash}) {\textbackslash}end\{document\}], and sample sizes [N1 and N2]).

Hence, we can see the need for the underlying assumption of equal population variances in this test. The Student's t-test performs badly when these variances are actually unequal, both in terms of Type I and Type II errors (Zar 1996). Figure 1 suggests that unequal sample variances are common in behavioral ecology. Although it is true that unequal variances are less problematic if sample sizes are similar, in practice, we often have quite unequal sample sizes (Figure 2). Hence, I suggest that the Student's t-test is frequently used in behavioral ecology when one of its important underlying assumptions is violated, and consequently, its performance is unreliable.},
