## Transforming non-normally distributed variables

One option for dealing with a non-normally distributed varaible is to transform it into its square, square root or logarithmic value. The new transformed variable may be normally distributed and therefore a parametric test can be used. First we check the distribution of the variable for normality, e.g. by plotting a density plot.

You can calculate a new, transformed, variable using **Data \> Compute**. For example, to create a new column of data based on the log of length of stay:

-   click into an empty column at the end of the spreadsheet
-   click **Data \> Compute**
-   provide a name for the new variable, here `log(length of stay + 1)`
-   enter the formula for the new variable in the *f~x~* box, here `LN(los + 1)`
-   hit enter to create the new column:

You can now check whether this logged variable is normally distributed as described in Module 2, for example by plotting a density plot as shown in Figure 9.2.

To obtain the back-transformed mean, we can use a calculator to calculate the exponential mean:

$e^{3.407232} = 30.18$

If your transformed variable is approximately normally distributed, you can apply parametric tests such as the t-test. In the Worked Example 9.1 dataset, the variable `infect` (presence of nosocomial infection) is a binary categorical variable. To test the hypothesis that patients with nosocomial infection have a different length of stay to patients without infection, you can conduct a t-test on the `log(length of stay + 1)` variable. You will need to back transform your mean values, as shown in Worked Example 9.1 in the course notes when reporting your results.

## Wilcoxon ranked-sum test

The Wilcoxon ranked-sum test will be demonstrated using the length of stay data in `mod09_infection.rds`. Here, our continuous variable is `los` and the grouping variable is `infect`. Note that jamovi uses calls the Wilcoxon ranked-sum test the **Mann-Whitney U** test. The two tests are equivalent.

The Wilcoxon ranked-sum test is conducted in **Analyses \> T-Tests \> Independent Samples T-Test** in jamovi. The screen is set up in the same way as for a two-sample t-test. To conduct the Wilcoxon ranked-sum test, untick the **Student's** box and click the **Mann-Whitney U** box in the **Tests** section:

Note that the result appears without any descriptive analyses. You should obtain the appropriate descriptive statistics in the usual way.

## Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test

The Wilcoxon ranked-sum test is conducted in jamovi using **Analyses \> T-Tests \> Paired Samples T-Test**.

We will demonstrate using the dataset on the arthritis drug cross-over trial (`mod09_arthritis.csv`). Like the paired t-test the paired data need to be in separate columns.

## Estimating rank correlation coefficients

The analyses for Spearman's and Kendall's rank correlation are conducted in similar ways using **Regression \> Correlation Matrix**:
