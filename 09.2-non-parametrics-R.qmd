## Transforming non-normally distributed variables

One option for dealing with a non-normally distributed varaible is to transform it into its square, square root or logarithmic value. The new transformed variable may be normally distributed and therefore a parametric test can be used. First we check the distribution of the variable for normality, e.g. by plotting a histogram.

You can calculate a new, transformed, variable using standard commands. For example, to create a new column of data based on the log of length of stay:

```{r}
library(jmv)

hospital <- readRDS("data/examples/mod09_infection.rds")

hospital$ln_los <- log(hospital$los+1)
descriptives(data=hospital, vars=c(los, ln_los))
```
You can now check whether this logged variable is normally distributed as described in Module 2, for example by plotting a histogram as shown in Figure 9.2.

To obtain the back-transformed mean, we can use the `exp` command to `anti-log` the mean:

```{r}
exp(3.407232)
```

If your transformed variable is approximately normally distributed, you can apply parametric tests such as the t-test. In the Worked Example 9.1 dataset, the variable `infect` (presence of nosocomial infection) is a binary categorical variable. To test the hypothesis that patients with nosocomial infection have a different length of stay to patients without infection, you can conduct a t-test on the `ln_los` variable. You will need to back transform your mean values, as shown in Worked Example 9.1 in the course notes when reporting your results.

## Wilcoxon ranked-sum test

We use the `wilcox.test` function to perform the Wilcoxon ranked-sum test:

```
wilcox.test(continuous_variable ~ group_variable, data=df)
```

The Wilcoxon ranked-sum test will be demonstrated using the length of stay data in `mod09_infection.rds`. Here, out continuous variable is `los` and the grouping variable is `infect`.

```{r}
wilcox.test(los ~ infect, data=hospital)
```

## Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test

The `wilcox.test` function can also be used to conduct the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test. The specification of the variables is a little different, in that each variable is specified as `dataframe$variable`:

```
wilcox.test(df$continuous_variable_1, df$continuous_variable_1, paired=TRUE)
```

We will demonstrate using the dataset on the arthritis drug cross-over trial (`mod09_arthritis.csv`). Like the paired t-test the paired data need to be in separate columns.

```{r}
arthritis <- read.csv("data/examples/mod09_arthritis.csv")

wilcox.test(arthritis$drug_1, arthritis$drug_2, 
            paired=TRUE)
```

## Estimating rank correlation coefficients
The analyses for Spearman's and Kendall's rank correlation are conducted in similar ways:

```{r}
lung <- read.csv("data/examples/mod08_lung_function.csv")

cor.test(lung$Height, lung$FVC, method="spearman")

cor.test(lung$Height, lung$FVC, method="kendall")
```
