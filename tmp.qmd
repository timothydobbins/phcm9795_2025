An alternative way of producing barcharts is via a Module called **surveymv** that we add to jamovi. To install the module, click the **Analyses** tab, and click the large **+** at the top-right of the window. Choose **jamovi library**:

Click **Available** and search for `surveymv`, then click install:

The module has now been installed. To run the module, click the up-arrow to return to the **Analyses** tab, click the large **+** and choose **surveymv > Survey Plots**:

We will demonstrate the module by recreating @fig-bar-4, a figure of the relative frequencies of sex within stage of disease. To open the module options, click the large **+** and choose **surveymv > Survey Plots**:

We choose the variable we want to plot, here `Sex`. We want to plot sex within each stage, so `Stage` is entered as a **Grouping Variable**:

This has plotted a clustered bar chart, we want a stacked bar chart, so select **Stacked bar**. Also, we want to plot percentages, not counts, so choose **Percentages**:

Our stacked relative frequency chart has been completed. While this produces a bar chart with horizontal bars, it often performs better with labelling of the groups than the previous method.
