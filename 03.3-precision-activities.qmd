### Activity 3.1 {-}

An investigator wishes to study people living with agoraphobia (fear of open spaces). The investigator places an advertisement in a newspaper asking for volunteer participants. A total of 100 replies are received of which the investigator randomly selects 30. However, only 15 volunteers turn up for their interview.

1.	Which of the following statements is true?

a)	The final 15 participants are likely to be a representative sample of the population available to the investigator
b)	The final 15 participants are likely to be a representative sample of the population of people with agoraphobia
c)	The randomly selected 30 participants are likely to be a representative sample of people with agoraphobia who replied to the newspaper advertisement
d)	None of the above

2.	The basic problem confronted by the investigator is that:

a)	The accessible population might be different from the target population
b)	The sample has been chosen using an unethical method
c)	The sample size was too small
d)	It is difficult to obtain a sample of people with agoraphobia in a scientific way

### Activity 3.2 {-}

A dental epidemiologist wishes to estimate the mean weekly consumption of sweets among children of a given age in her area. After devising a method which enables her to determine the weekly consumption of sweets by a child, she conducted a pilot survey and found that the standard deviation of sweet consumption by the children per week is 85 gm (assuming this is the population standard deviation, $\sigma$). She considers taking a random sample for the main survey of:

- 25 children, or 
- 100 children, or 
- 625 children or 
- 3,000 children.

a)	Estimate the standard error and maximum likely (95% confidence) error of the sample mean for each of these four sample sizes.
b)	What happens to the standard error as the sample size increases? What can you say about the precision of the sample mean as the sample size increases?

### Activity 3.3 {-}

The dataset for this activity is the same as the one used in Activity 1.4 in Module 1. The file is `Activity1.4.dta` or `Activity1.4.rds` on Moodle.

a) Plot a histogram of diastolic BP and describe the distribution.
b) Use Stata or R to obtain an estimate of the mean, standard error of the mean and the 95% confidence interval for the mean diastolic blood pressure.
c) Interpret the 95% confidence interval for the mean diastolic blood pressure.

### Activity 3.4 {-}

Suppose that a random sample of 81 newborn babies delivered in a hospital located in a poor neighbourhood during the last year had a mean birth weight of 2.7 kg and a standard deviation of 0.9 kg. Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the unknown population mean. Interpret the 95% confidence interval.
